## Objective
To analyze the differences in economic recovery between Eurozone and non-Eurozone countries using the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) methodology.

## Methodology
- A dataset from the OECD Data Explorer was used, covering GDP, population, inflation (CPI), unemployment (HUR), and government debt (GGDEBT).
- Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis was conducted, comparing:
  - **Spain (Eurozone) vs. Sweden (Non-Eurozone)**
  - **France (Eurozone) vs. UK (Non-Eurozone)**

## Key Results
- France showed a positive economic recovery due to Eurozone membership.
- Spainâ€™s recovery was constrained compared to Sweden due to limited monetary policy flexibility.

## Tools and Data Sources
- **Tools Used:** R (Jupyter Notebook), ggplot2 and stargazer.
- **Data Source:** OECD Data Explorer (https://data.oecd.org).
